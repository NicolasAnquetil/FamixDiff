I orchestrate the computing of the diff of 2 models.  Base: MooseModel  or OrionModel; target MooseModel

I am the entry point class of the diff. I use a generator to compute a first pass of the diff (see subclasses of FAMIXDiffAbstractComputer) and transformers that transforms the diff results into more complex diff elements (see subclasses of FamixDiffAbstractTransformator).

I collaborate with FamixDiffAbstractTransformator, FamixDiffAbstractGenerator and FamixDiffResult.

Public API and Key Messages

- see class side for creation 
- #result to get the diff result

   One simple example is simply gorgeous.
