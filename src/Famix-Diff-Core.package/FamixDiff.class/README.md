I am a diff utility for FAMIX models.

I hold two models:
- The base model stored in #base instance variable.
- The target model stored in #target instance variable.

Once I computed the difference (delta) between #base and #target models by executing #diff method,
- I store the entity changes in #changes instance variable.
- I store the associations changes in #assocChanges variable.

My #tolerance instance variable is used to give some flexibility for the match between two entities.
Indeed, this variable is a real between 0 and 1 that represents the percentage of tolerance for a match.
- tolerance = 0 (0%)      implies that both entities must be strictly equals.
- tolerance = 1 (100%) implies that entities can be completly different.
